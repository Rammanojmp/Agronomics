        <p>Welcome to the crop progress tracking tool! By uploading a monthly image of your crops, you can monitor their growth and overall health over time. This helps you make informed decisions about crop care and schedule timely interventions.</p>
        
        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>Our system allows you to regularly upload images of your crop fields. Over time, you can view a history of these images to track progress, identify improvements, and detect any emerging issues.</p>

        <h3>Steps to Upload Your Crop Progress Image</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Click on the "Choose File" button below.</li>
            <li>Select the image of your crop field that you want to record for progress tracking.</li>
            <li>Click "Upload Image" to submit the file.</li>
            <li>Your image will be added to your progress history, allowing you to compare it with previous uploads.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Why Track Crop Progress?</h3>
        <p>Regularly tracking your crop images helps you monitor growth patterns, notice early signs of stress or nutrient deficiency, and plan for interventions such as fertilization or pest management.</p>

        <h3>Supported File Formats</h3>
        <p>For best results, please upload images in the following formats:</p>
